# Ubiquitous Language Draft

---

### Term
**Definition**

- *Examples (1)*
- *Examples (2)*

---

##### Purpose
This document captures the **shared vocabulary** agreed upon by the team during Event Storming.  
It ensures everyone (tech, business, product, ops) speaks the same language and reduces ambiguity.

---

##### Conventions
- **Clear, business-friendly names** — avoid tech-only jargon unless it’s part of the domain language.
- **No duplicates** — each term is unique and unambiguous.
- **Examples are required** for every term.
- Keep definitions **short and precise** (1–2 sentences max).

---

##### Next Steps
1. Review and validate definitions with domain experts.
2. Add new terms as they emerge in further workshops.
3. Keep this document **living** — update it when the meaning of a term changes.
