# Ubiquitous Language – Draft

## Purpose
This document captures the **shared vocabulary** agreed upon by the team during Event Storming.  
It ensures everyone (tech, business, product, ops) speaks the same language and reduces ambiguity.

## Terms & Definitions

| Term | Definition | Example Usage | Notes |
|------|------------|---------------|-------|
| **[Term 1]** | Short, precise definition in plain language. | Sentence showing the term in context. | Any clarifications, constraints, or synonyms. |
| **[Term 2]** | ... | ... | ... |
| **[Term 3]** | ... | ... | ... |

---

## Conventions
- **Clear, business-friendly names** — avoid tech-only jargon unless it’s part of the domain language.
- **No duplicates** — each term is unique and unambiguous.
- **Examples are required** for every term.
- Keep definitions **short and precise** (1–2 sentences max).

---

## Next Steps
1. Review and validate definitions with domain experts.
2. Add new terms as they emerge in further workshops.
3. Keep this document **living** — update it when the meaning of a term changes.
